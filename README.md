# 🎙️ Multilingual Emotion Detection in Voice

This project implements a system to detect human emotions from voice recordings across multiple languages using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

## 📌 Overview

Emotion detection from voice is a challenging task that involves analyzing speech features to determine the speaker's emotional state. This project extracts relevant audio features from multilingual datasets and uses a neural network model to classify emotions such as:

* Happy
* Sad
* Angry
* Neutral
* Fearful
* Disgust
* Surprised

## 🗃️ Datasets

The system supports multilingual datasets and can be adapted to include:

* **RAVDESS** (English)
* **EmoDB** (German)
* **CREMA-D**
* Custom multilingual corpora

> Ensure all audio files are preprocessed to a common sampling rate and format for consistency.

## ⚙️ Features Extracted

* **MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)**
* **Chroma**
* **Mel Spectrogram**
* **Zero Crossing Rate**
* **Spectral Contrast**

These features are extracted using `librosa` and combined into a single feature vector per audio clip.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The model is built using **TensorFlow/Keras** with a typical structure:

* Input layer for extracted features
* Dense hidden layers with dropout
* Output layer with softmax activation for emotion classification

Other possible models:

* CNN (for spectrogram images)
* LSTM (for sequential audio features)

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

* Accuracy
* Confusion Matrix
* Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

## ▶️ Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook multilingual_emotion_detection_in_voice.ipynb
   ```
4. Add or update your dataset path as needed.
5. Train the model and test with sample audio clips.

## 🔄 Multilingual Support

The system can normalize and align emotion labels across different languages and datasets. It is extendable to handle new languages by integrating corresponding datasets.
